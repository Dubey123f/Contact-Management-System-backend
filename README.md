Contact Management System
Project Description
This Contact Management System is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It allows users to manage their contacts by adding, editing, deleting, and viewing contact information. The application supports basic CRUD operations and stores contact details in a MongoDB database.

Key Features:
Add new contacts with essential details (name, phone, email, etc.).
Edit existing contacts to keep information up-to-date.
Delete contacts when no longer needed.
Search functionality to filter contacts based on name or email.
Responsive UI built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS.
API endpoints created with Express.js to handle contact data operations.
Tech Stack:
Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB
Authentication (Optional): JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
Major Technical Decisions:
MERN Stack: Chose MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js for a modern full-stack JavaScript development experience.
MongoDB: Used for its flexibility in handling unstructured data, especially useful for contact information that may vary across users.
JWT Authentication: If implemented, ensures secure user authentication and session management.
App Workflow:
Frontend (React):
Users interact with the application through the frontend. React is used to render components such as ContactList, AddContact, EditContact, etc.
State management is handled using useState and useEffect hooks.
Axios is used to make API requests to the backend.
Backend (Node.js/Express):
The backend exposes API routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting contacts (CRUD operations).
Each route corresponds to a controller that interacts with the MongoDB database.
Database (MongoDB):
MongoDB stores contact information in the form of documents in the contacts collection.
Schema is defined to enforce the structure of contact documents (e.g., name, email, phone).
Database Schema
javascript
Copy code
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

// Contact Schema
const contactSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: { type: String, required: true },
    email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
    phone: { type: String, required: true },
    address: { type: String },
    createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now }
});

const Contact = mongoose.model('Contact', contactSchema);

module.exports = Contact;



Setup Instructions
Prerequisites:
Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
MongoDB installed locally or a MongoDB Atlas account to use a cloud database.
Backend Setup (Node.js & Express):
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd <project-folder>
Install backend dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your MongoDB connection string:
makefile
Copy code
MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>
Start the backend server:
bash
Copy code
npm start
The server will be running at http://localhost:5000.
Frontend Setup (React):
Navigate to the client directory (or where the React app is located):
bash
Copy code
cd client
Install frontend dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the frontend server:
bash
Copy code
npm start
The React app will be running at http://localhost:3000.
Database Schema Script:
If you're using a local MongoDB setup, you can create the contacts collection using the following script in the MongoDB shell or a database management tool like MongoDB Compass:

javascript
Copy code
use contact_management_system;

db.createCollection("contacts");
For cloud-based databases (MongoDB Atlas), ensure your connection string is correct in the .env file and that your cluster is properly set up.

API Endpoints:
GET /api/contacts - Fetch all contacts.
GET /api/contacts/:id - Fetch a single contact by ID.
POST /api/contacts - Create a new contact.
PUT /api/contacts/:id - Update an existing contact.
DELETE /api/contacts/:id - Delete a contact.
